🚀 QUICK START GUIDE
===================

1. GET API KEY (Optional but Recommended):
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Sign up (free $5 credit!)
   - Create API key
   - Copy the key (starts with sk-...)

2. ADD TO .env FILE:
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" > .env
   
   OR create .env file manually with:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here

3. LAUNCH THE APP:
   ./start.sh
   
   OR:
   python3 -m streamlit run app.py

4. OPEN IN BROWSER:
   The terminal will show a URL like:
   http://localhost:8501
   
   Copy and paste it in your browser!

5. ASK QUESTIONS:
   - "How to turn on indicator in MG Astor?"
   - "Which engine oil to use in Tiago?"

NOTE: First run takes 2-3 minutes (processing PDFs)
      Subsequent runs are much faster!

The app works WITHOUT API key too (uses simple extraction)
